Watch this video: (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80BKaTrSzXc) to see how this works!

This script will calculate your rank automatically for NonPRB Time Trials on the Mario Kart DS Players page (THIS DOES NOT WORK FOR PRB OR OTHER GAMES)

You MUST be using my sheet in order for this to work. (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17EEoebeIVbOjs27XbknDsH1guNnw2F1L-ac5HcsJT1E/edit#gid=469379808)

To save time calculating, the sheet assumes any new times you put in are better than your old time (as they should be). The consequence of this is that times outside the set of 100 times you are in will result in an incorrect rank (defaulting to 1). Slight adjustments within your set of 100 times (in case of an incorrectly submitted slower time) will still work as intended.
